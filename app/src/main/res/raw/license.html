<p>This Evaluation License Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) is entered into electronically as of the date of
    installation of the NHS3100 Temperature Logging App (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) by and between NXP
    Semiconductors Belgium N.V. having its principal place of business at Interleuvenlaan 80, 3001 Leuven, Belgium
    (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;NXP&#8221;) and the user who successfully downloaded and installed the NHS3100
    Temperature Logging App (hereinafter: &#8220;Licensee&#8221;).</p>

<p class="fullindented">Whereas, it is beneficial to NXP to enable prospective customers, analysts and test labs to
    evaluate NXP&apos;s NHS3100 hardware as specified in Exhibit A below, by making use of the NHS3100 Temperature
    Logging App; and</p>

<p class="fullindented">Whereas, it is beneficial for the Licensee to be able to evaluate NXP&apos;s NHS3100 hardware
    with the NHS3100 Temperature Logging App. The NHS3100 Temperature Logging App as downloaded and installed by
    Licensee and related documentation are hereinafter collectively referred to as: &#8220;Software&#8221;;</p>

<p class="fullindented">Now therefore, the parties agree as follows:</p>

<h2>1. Grant of License and Limitation of Use</h2>

<p class="indentedbutone">A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement NXP grants to Licensee a

<p class="indentedbutone">B. The Software may only be used for demonstrations and evaluations of functionality. It is
    not intended for use in or use in combination with a medical device and/or as part of a pharmaceutical application
    and should not be used for decisions concerning the validity of temperature sensitive materials.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">C. Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (i) use the Software for
    commercial or revenue generating purposes; (ii) copy, translate, modify or make derivative works of any portion of

    consent; or (ix) otherwise use any portion of the Software in any manner not expressly authorized herein.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">D. Except for those rights specifically granted herein, NXP, its affiliates and its/their
    suppliers reserve all right, title and interest in and to the Software. No license, right or interest in any

    hereunder.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">C. The license granted herein does not include any license, right, power or authority to
    subject the Software, in whole or in part, to Open Source Licensing Terms. As used herein, &#8220;Open Source

    regarding the Work; (b) the granting of permission for creating derivative works regarding the Work; or (c) the
    granting of a royalty-free license to any party under intellectual property rights regarding the Work. By means of

    ASSUMED BY NXP. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE REMAINS
    WITH LICENSEE.</p>

<h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Since the NHS3100 Temperature Logger App and the corresponding hardware are provided for evaluation and demonstration

    NXP, ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS/THEIR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN
    ANY ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE
    FURNISHED HEREUNDER. THE DAMAGES EXCLUDED UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
    ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED PROFITS, LOSS OF PROGRAMMING AND/OR PRODUCTION MATERIALS, AND DAMAGE TO THE BUSINESS
    REPUTATION OF LICENSEE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT LICENSEE MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL DAMAGES REFERENCED ABOVE AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF NXP,
    ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS/THEIR LICENSORS UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND LICENSEE&apos;S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

    BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<h2>6. Product Maintenance</h2>

    updates provided voluntarily by NXP shall be covered by this Agreement.</p>

<h2>7. General</h2>

<p class="indentedbutone">A. The validity, performance and construction of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws
    of Belgium without regard to provisions concerning conflicts of laws. The parties consent to the jurisdiction and
    venue of the competent courts of Leuven, Belgium, for all disputes or litigation arising under this Agreement;
    provided, however, that each party may enforce its or its affiliates&apos; trade secret and other intellectual
    property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to injunctive relief.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">B. The prevailing party in any legal action arising out of, or related to, this Agreement
    shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have, to reimbursement for its expenses
    incurred in such action, including court costs and reasonable attorney&apos;s fees.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">C. Licensee acknowledges that if NXP is required to bring an action to enforce the provisions
    of this Agreement, the damages may be irreparable and difficult to measure and that NXP shall be entitled to seek
    equitable relief including a preliminary injunction in addition to any other relief available. Licensee agrees that
    in the event that NXP seeks an injunction hereunder, Licensee hereby waives any requirement for the posting of a
    bond or any other security.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">D. Insofar as these relate to the activities under this Agreement, Licensee will comply with
    all applicable export and import control laws and regulations and, in particular, will not export or re-export the
    Software, or any portion thereof, or documentation pertaining thereto, without all required national and
    international government licenses, approvals, or waivers. Licensee agrees that it will not knowingly transfer,
    divert, export or re-export, directly or indirectly, any product, hardware, software, including software source
    code, or technical data restricted by such regulations or by other applicable national regulations, received from
    NXP under this Agreement, or any direct product of such hardware, software or technical data to any person, firm,
    entity country or destination to which such transfer, diversion, export or re-export is restricted or prohibited by
    applicable law, without obtaining prior authorization from the applicable competent government authorities to the
    extent required by those laws. This provision shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>

<p class="indentedbutone">E. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may not be superseded, modified, or amended
    except in writing which states that it is such a modification, and is signed by an authorized representative of each
    party hereto.</p>

    to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral,
